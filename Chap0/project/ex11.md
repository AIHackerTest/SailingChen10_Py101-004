PS C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop> py -3 ex11.py
How old are you?
25
How tall are you?
167
How much do you weigh?
67
So, you're '25' old, '167' tall and '67' heavy.

```
PS C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop> cat ex11.py
# coding=utf-8

print ("How old are you?"),
age = input()  # raw_input used in python2, but input in python3
print ("How tall are you?"),
height = input()
print ("How much do you weigh?"),
weight = input()

print ("So, you're %r old, %r tall and %r heavy." % (age, height, weight))

`raw_input` 用在 python2 , 在 python3 里面则用 `in_put`
